# Requirements Clustering Analysis

This project analyzes requirements data from Excel files stored in Google Drive using machine learning techniques. It performs text preprocessing, clustering analysis using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Features

- Google Drive integration for reading XLSX files
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
- Export results to Excel for visualization in Looker Studio

## Prerequisites
